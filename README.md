# MyMTG
MyMTG is a framework to allow players to organize their play.  
There is still a whole lot to do, but the idea is that developers can simply hook into the API to use their app.  
players don't need an account for every individual app, but can rather login with one account on every app.  
THe API is a bit limited at the moment, but I expect it to get expanded in the near future.

# MyMTG-Web
This is the official Web client for MyMTG developed by FinlayDaG33k.  
In theory, you should be able to just drop it on a webhost and it should be good to go.  
No configuration needed!  
This repo is also the first place where new functionality gets pushed to, so if you want the latest functions of MyMTG, then look no further!
